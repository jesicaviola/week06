            What do the three Beaches Resorts have in common?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Before we pick out our best Beaches resort, it's worth looking at the things that you'll get 
            regardless of which resort you choose. All three resorts include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>childcare and kids group for ages 0 - 17, with various age groups so your teenager won't 
            be stuck with your five year old. There's also a partnership with Sesame Street, so younger kids 
            can do activities with Big Bird and watch parades.</li>
            <li>meals and drinks, including some pretty swanky restaurants</li>
            <li>tips and taxes</li>
            <li>a big range of watersports and land sports, most of which are included in the cost of the 
            holiday</li>
            <li>spa facilities</li>
            <li>a night club, just in case you decide that you want to be 19 again 
            (<cite>Ed: surely you mean 17?</cite>)</li>
          </ul>

          Which Beaches Resort gets the best reviews? Beaches Negril, Beaches Ochos Rios or Beaches 
          Turks and Caicos?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The good news is that all three Beaches Resorts get outstanding customer reviews. In fact, 
          there's very little to separate them based on reviews.
