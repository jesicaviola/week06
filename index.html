        <p>1 / 11 -Mars Science City is planned for the desert outside Dubai, intended as a space to develop technology to colonize Mars.</p> 
        <img src="img/imagen2.jpg">   
        <p>2 / 11 -Architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) have designed a prototype of a city for humans to live on Mars, and then adapted the design for the Emirati desert.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen3.jpg">   
        <p>3 / 11 -The design is made up of biodomes, each covered with a transparent polyethylene membrane.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen4.jpg"> 
        <p>4 / 11 -On Mars, buildings would be 3D printed under the domes, using Martian soil. On Earth, desert sand could be used instead.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen5.jpg"> 
        <p>5 / 11 -The design features water-filled skylights, which on Mars would shield residents from radiation, while allowing light to enter the rooms.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen6.jpg">
        <p>6 / 11 -BIG's design for the Earth-bound Science City sets aside areas for research into living on Mars, including growing food there.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen7.jpg">
        <p>7 / 11 -It also includes an exhibition space.</p>
        <img src="img/imagen8.jpg">
        <p>8 / 11 -Dubai's Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) is behind the initiative. It says Mars Science City is still in the concept stage, and that it hasn't yet settled on a design or architect for the final build.</p>
