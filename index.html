          1 / 11 -Mars Science City is planned for the desert outside Dubai, intended as a space to develop 
          technology to colonize Mars.

          2 / 11 -Architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) have designed a prototype of a city for humans to live 
          on Mars, and then adapted the design for the Emirati desert.

          4 / 11 -On Mars, buildings would be 3D printed under the domes, using Martian soil. On Earth, desert 
          sand could be used instead.
        </p>
        <img src="img/imagen5.jpg"> 
        <p>5 / 11 -The design features water-filled skylights, which on Mars would shield residents from 
          radiation, while allowing light to enter the rooms.
        </p>
        <img src="img/imagen6.jpg">
        <p>6 / 11 -BIG's design for the Earth-bound Science City sets aside areas for research into living 
          on Mars, including growing food there.

          Science City is still in the concept stage, and that it hasn't yet settled on a design or architect 
          for the final build.
